SteganoSynth
============

A few weeks ago I was going through [Computerphile's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) videos on image processing and image data to kill some time. Eventually I came across David Domminney Fowler's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4cKlez0OCM) where he takes image data to create some glitchy music. I thought it was an awesome idea and wanted to try it myself and expand on it.

Version 1.0
-----------
Version one is very similar to David's video linked above -- add an image and the synth will go pixel by pixel playing frequencies based on color data in that pixel. I added a node editor so the user can decide what component of a pixel drives what component of the frequencies and a dropdown to allow a user to choose which scale they want to play in.

TODO
----
+ Add more fun scales/nodes
+ Add collage mode (up to 3 or 4 images/synths going at once)
+ Add file export
+ Allow real-time node editor patching
+ Add an effects window
+ I'll need a nicer UI at some point
